# Malicious URL Detection Using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project implements a comprehensive machine learning solution for detecting malicious URLs to enhance cybersecurity protection. The system analyzes various URL features and HTTP response characteristics to classify URLs as benign or malicious, helping organizations proactively identify and mitigate potential security threats.

## Dataset Information

The dataset contains **185,180 samples** with **11 input features** designed to capture various characteristics of web URLs:

### Dataset Features

1. **compromissionType**: Type of compromise or fraud (e.g., defacement, phishing) - Categorical
2. **isHiddenFraudulent**: Boolean indicator of URL fraudulence (TRUE for fraudulent, FALSE for benign)
3. **contentLength**: Length of HTTP content in bytes - Numerical
4. **serverType**: Type of server hosting the URL (e.g., Apache/2.2) - Categorical
5. **poweredBy**: Technology or framework powering the server (e.g., PHP, ASP.NET) - Categorical
6. **contentType**: MIME type of content served by the URL (e.g., text/html) - Categorical
7. **lastModified**: Last modified date and time of HTTP content - Datetime/Categorical
8. **url_length**: Length of the URL string - Numerical
9. **num_dots**: Number of dots (.) in the URL - Numerical
10. **num_special**: Number of special characters (non-alphanumeric) in the URL - Numerical
11. **has_https**: Indicator of HTTPS usage (1 for HTTPS, 0 otherwise) - Boolean

The dataset exhibits significant class imbalance with a **fraudulent ratio of 4.70%**, requiring specialized handling techniques for optimal model performance.

## Technical Implementation

### Data Preprocessing
- **Missing Value Treatment**: Systematic handling of missing values in categorical features (serverType, poweredBy, contentType, lastModified) using "Unknown" replacement
- **Feature Engineering**: Creation of URL-based features including length, special character count, and protocol detection
- **Data Type Conversion**: Categorical features converted to numerical using factorization for machine learning compatibility
- **Class Imbalance**: Addressed through cost-sensitive learning approaches with custom cost matrices

### Machine Learning Models

The project implements and evaluates multiple classification algorithms:

1. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
2. **Decision Tree Classifier**
3. **Random Forest Classifier**

### Cost-Sensitive Analysis

Given the cybersecurity context, a comprehensive cost analysis framework was implemented:

- **False Positive Cost**: €100 per URL (unnecessary investigation resources)
- **False Negative Cost**: €1,000 per URL (security breach consequences)
- **Cost Optimization**: Models prioritized minimizing Type II errors (false negatives) to prevent security incidents

### Evaluation Metrics

Models were assessed using multiple performance indicators:

- **Accuracy**: Overall classification correctness
- **Precision**: Positive predictive value
- **Recall**: Sensitivity to malicious URLs
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **ROC AUC**: Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
- **Log Loss**: Probabilistic classification accuracy
- **Custom Cost Metric**: Financial impact assessment

## Key Findings and Business Impact

### Model Performance

The comparative analysis revealed optimal performance characteristics across different algorithms, with careful attention to the trade-off between false positives and false negatives in the cybersecurity context.

### Business Value
